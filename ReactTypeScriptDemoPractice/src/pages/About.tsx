      <div>From this tutorial I'm learning that const elements build out what's on each page</div>
      <div>the router from const app creates the actual paths to these pages</div>
      <div>When I initually created this content fromt he App.tsx page it did not work. This is because each link with content needs to have its own file in the src file</div>
