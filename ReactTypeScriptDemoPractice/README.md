# I'm using this resource to self teach Typescript and React 

## so far, I've learned:


6/4
- a few important dependencies needed in package.json to run a react application
- why the bootstrap file is an important component of react projects
- work through how to build out full routing system in react applicaton (through  building react router)
- installed react-router and react-router-dom
- Created home-page route and /about route.

6/5 - 6/8
- I'm learning about how to build more dynamic routes (dynamic: the url includes a key and we want access to that key value)
- I created an array of objects, learned howv how to use map in react to iterate over large amounts of data
- map returned jsx code (our divs)
- used map on a nested collection
- used state to set some local variables for component
- the state is a varialble and react lets us change its value
- jsx gives as an onClick prop when we're working with links
- the useEffect component runs a set of actions in the CLientDetail function
