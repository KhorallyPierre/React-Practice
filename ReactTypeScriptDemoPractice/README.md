# I'm using this resource to self teach Typescript and React 

## so far, I've learned:


6/4
- a few important dependencies needed in package.json to run a react application
- why the bootstrap file is an important component of react projects
- work through how to build out full routing system in react applicaton (through  building react router)
- installed react-router and react-router-dom
- Created home-page route and /about route.

6/5 - 6/8
- I'm learning about how to build more dynamic routes (dynamic: the url includes a key and we want access to that key value)
- I created an array of objects, learned howv how to use map in react to iterate over large amounts of data
- map returned jsx code (our divs)
- used map on a nested collection
- used state to set some local variables for component
- the state is a varialble and react lets us change its value
- jsx gives as an onClick prop when we're working with links
- the useEffect component runs a set of actions in the CLientDetail function

6/9
- focused on learning how to create a sliding pane component in a separate file 
- get different components to communicate with each other
- input data int oa form and have it autopopulate on the page
- gained understanding of form submission process 
- Created interface to define rules that allows isPaneOpen to be used
- typescript makes it so that whenever the form pane is called, error will be thrown if right pieces of data is not passed in (this is what we want during development)
- we turned the pane into a dedicated component
- setContent actually adds data to the page in a dynamic way
- learned how to work with forms
